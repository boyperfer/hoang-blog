The Lord of the Rings trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien is a novel series set in a fictional world of Middle-earth and tells the story of a mysterious Ring, which is enough danger to control all over the world. The fate of the world right now is determined by a young Hobbit named Frodo, who owns the Ring and become Ringbearer. Gandalf assigns him a tough task, destroying the Ring. After six months, He and his friends set off from home and lead to Mount Doom, the only place where the Ring was forged and can be destroyed, to find out the answer.

Tolkien can be said to have foreseen many of the post-modernists' concerns, even if he did not clearly answer them in postmodernism. While reading the Lord of the Rings, I found the characteristics of postmodern, and the most interesting finding that I want to mention is a great poem written by Bilbo Baggins to describe Aragorn, helping Forgo to make sure that Strider, Aragorn, is the real Strider. It is a great poem, which is far from our limited judgments of life.

All that is gold does not glitter: it implies that Aragorn, despite the sole direct male descendent of Elendil, is more likely to be a rough looking men. Most important people with power tend to hide their identity and do not always show who they actually are. In reality, gold is a symbol of beauty. However, in this case, it cannot bring us the shine of happiness and peace. It can solve our problems in terms of value but not in happiness and love.

Not all those who wander are lost: Aragorn spent his life traveling throughout Middle Earth to save innocent inhabitants and fight aganist the servants of Mordor. No matter what way you go but the matter is where you go. It might not be easy like a straight path. We may have experiences and obstacles along the way. However, they will be helping and shaping you into the person who you want to become at the end.

The old that is strong does not wither, deep roots are not reached by the frost: When LOTR events took place, Aragorn was over 80, which is the age of any man would wither, but he still looks young and strong like 30s. In reality, Something that we have planted carefully for long years cannot be easily destroyed. Truth will never be changed. Real strength will only increase with time. True dream will never die.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken, A light from the shadows shall spring Renewed shall be blade that was broken, The crownless again shall be king: Aragorn will revive from the ashes like a phoenix, lit a fire under people, and ignite a final war that will defeat Sauron for the last time. In reality, old things will be renewed its essence through new cycles of the natural law. The seed of renewal, which is forgotten, is in waiting and will be awakening on its perfect time.

In conclusion, Tolkien convey his messages and give us lessons by blurred lines between reality & fantasy in such beautiful words. Those are just my humble research, and I know there is still a lot of meaning behind it. ”The One Ring to rule them all”, thirsting power, is still relevant to American society. Tolkien’s readings reflects the concerns of the world via fictions. His works are timeless and worth reading.
