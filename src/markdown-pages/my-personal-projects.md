[From Thieu 1 With Love](http://fromthieu1withlove.herokuapp.com/) is a progressive web app hosted by Heroku primarily used framework React integrated with Redux to handle the view layer for the app. Stored on Firebase, images are simpler and easier in fetching and manipulating with complex animations. As a member of From Thieu 1 with Love, I created it with a purpose to memorize the first times that I served as a “Youth Leader”, who teaches the faith of Catholic and the Bible, and promote positive image of my catholic community.

[Zu Han Virus](https://zuhanvirus.herokuapp.com/) is a React-Redux web app implemented Mapbox as a global map and fetched data from Johns Hopkins University to track the spread of COVID-19 in the United States, Vietnam, and all over the worlds. The app is hosted by Heroku, and I can use in satisfaction wheather on mobile or laptop devices. The app helps me stay updated to the pandemic in easy and convenient ways with just one click thanks to the progressive web app feature of React

Hope everyone will enjoy it <br>
